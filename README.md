# JamJar CLI

JamJar is a CLI tool designed to "seal" the history of your Spotify playlists,
just like a jar preserves your favorite jams. Whether it's a collaborative
playlist with friends or your personal collection, JamJar saves every track
and its details into a database. No more losing track of who added what or
what songs were removedâ€”keep your playlist history fresh and intact, like
music in a jar!
